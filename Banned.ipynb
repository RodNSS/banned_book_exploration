Now it's freshman year of college for the winsome threesome, and the first semester is full of surprises. Bubbly Angela dives headfirst into sorority life, but faced with mean girls and hazing, she wonders whether she's a Greek girl after all. By choosing Santa Cruz, Maddie is finally surrounded by like-minded (i.e., not sorority-type) people, but feels lonelier than ever. And Zoe is keeping up a long-distance relationship with Doug, her high school boyfriend. She thought they'd be together forever, but after a few awful visits . . . not so much. In the face of all this change, what are the best friends to do? Make the most of every crazy moment, that's what. You only go to college once, after all.\"\n"

Determined to take his future into his own hands, Junior leaves his troubled school on the rez to attend an all-white farm town high school where the only other Indian is the school mascot. Heartbreaking, funny, and beautifully written, The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian, which is based on the author's own experiences, coupled with poignant drawings by Ellen Forney that reflect the character's art, chronicles the contemporary adolescence of one Native American boy as he attempts to break away from the life he was destined to live. With a forward by Markus Zusak, interviews with Sherman Alexie and Ellen Forney, and four-color interior art throughout, this edition is perfect for fans and collectors alike.\"\n"

       "2020 ALA Alex Award Winner 2020 Stonewall — Israel Fishman Non-fiction Award Honor Book In 2014, Maia Kobabe, who uses e/em/eir pronouns, thought that a comic of reading statistics would be the last autobiographical comic e would ever write. At the time, it was the only thing e felt comfortable with strangers knowing about em. Now, Gender Queer is here. Maia’s intensely cathartic autobiography charts eir journey of self-identity, which includes the mortification and confusion of adolescent crushes, grappling with how to come out to family and society, bonding with friends over erotic gay fanfiction, and facing the trauma and fundamental violation of pap smears. Started as a way to explain to eir family what it means to be nonbinary and asexual, Gender Queer is more than a personal story: it is a useful and touching guide on gender identity—what it means and how to think about it—for advocates, friends, and humans everywhere. This special deluxe hardcover edition of Gender Queer features a brand-new cover, exclusive art and sketches, and a TK from creator Maia Kobabe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           40\n",

Presenting the faith in its original clarity, it helps the reader to see the Virgin Mary within the perspective of sound biblical theology and solid Catholic tradition... [and is] also easy to understand...\" - Archbishop Socrates VillegasThe Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary (aka the Litany of Loreto) is a prayer usually said after the rosary, which invokes many of Mary's titles. The meanings of some titles, like \"Mystical Rose, Tower of David, Tower of Ivory, House of Gold, and Morning Star,\" are lost to us because language and culture evolved. Since these titles were meant to help us get to know her, our unfamiliarity with the titles becomes a missed opportunity to know Mary and emulate her virtues.This book goes deep in understanding the titles that burst with meaning when seen through Old Testament context. It combines Marian devotion, scriptural exegesis, Catholic doctrine, and Old Testament typology. Each title is thoroughly explained and summarized by suggesting how we might appreciate Mary. It may be read in one sitting to gain more insight about Mary, or each title may be used for meditation on each Saturday - as was the practice in Loreto.
